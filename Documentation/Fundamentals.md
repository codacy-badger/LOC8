# Project Fundamentals

## Measurement Units

This project follow SI (The International System of Units)

- Meter for length.
- Kilogram for mass.
- Second for time.
- Radian for angels.
- Tesla for magnetic field. _(In SI base units:	kg⋅s⁻²⋅A⁻¹)_


## Kinematic Equations
   The equations can be utilized for any motion that can be described as being either a constant velocity motion or a constant acceleration motion.
   They can never be used over any time period during which the acceleration is changing. Each of the kinematic equations include four variables.
